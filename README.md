# BESS Simulator (skeleton)

This repo will host a simulator for grid-tied battery assets (BESS) with registration, telemetry, and dispatch flows.

- See `DESIGN.md` for the current design and open questions.
- Current state: scaffold only; implementation TBD.

## Quick start

```bash
cargo run
```

(Currently just runs the placeholder main; simulator implementation to follow.)
